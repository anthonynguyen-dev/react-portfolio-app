      <p>
        The technology industry has always interested me. I found myself
        appreciating the continuous progress that this industry goes through and
        I am excited to contribute to it. I have many skills and attributes that
        can positively affect this industry that I have learned over the years.
        I have an appreciation for learning and enjoy challenging myself to
        experience new things across many industries. I feel that this could be
        helpful in the ever-changing world of technology.
